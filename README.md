# Machine-Learning-Projects
A comprehensive collection of Machine Learning models focusing on Healthcare AI and Predictive Analytics. Includes algorithms for detecting Diabetes, Malaria, and Heart Disease using Python and Scikit-Learn

# 🤖 Machine Learning & Healthcare AI Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
This repository houses a collection of **Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning models** developed during my academic tenure. The primary focus is on **Healthcare Diagnostics**, where I applied algorithms to predict disease likelihood based on medical datasets.

## 🏥 Key Projects: Healthcare AI

### 1. 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction
* **Objective:** To predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on vitals (Age, Sex, CP, Cholesterol, etc.).
* **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) & Logistic Regression.
* **Accuracy:** Optimized for high sensitivity to minimize false negatives.

### 2. 🩸 Diabetes Detection
* **Objective:** A diagnostic tool that classifies patients as diabetic/non-diabetic based on insulin levels, BMI, and glucose.
* **Tech Stack:** Support Vector Machines (SVM) & Decision Trees.

### 3. 🦟 Malaria Cell Detection
* **Objective:** To automate the diagnosis of Malaria by analyzing blood smear images.
* **Algorithm:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) / Deep Learning.
* **Input:** Cell images (Parasitized vs. Uninfected).

### 4. 🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction
* **Objective:** Early stage risk assessment using patient lifestyle and health data.
* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier.
